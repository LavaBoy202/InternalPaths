# InternalPaths


## Description
I recently discovered that the University of Waterloo has many internal paths to builidngs all over their campus to keep their students warm.
<br>These paths range from builing to building, go underground, and can be difficult for students to navigate.
<br>InternalPaths provides students with a guide to help find their way around campus while taking advantage of indoor walking routes!
